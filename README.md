# AVR UART Project

## Overview

This project is a basic AVR microcontroller program that demonstrates UART communication. The code initializes UART with a baud rate of 9600 and continuously sends the message "Hello" every second.

- `Makefile`: Build configuration file for compiling the project.
- `src/`: Directory containing source code and compiled output.
  - `main.c`: Main source file containing the UART communication code.
  - `main.bin`: Binary output file.
  - `main.elf`: Executable and Linkable Format file.
  - `main.hex`: Intel HEX format file for programming.
  - `output.txt`: Output file generated by the program.

## Requirements

- **AVR Microcontroller**: Compatible with ATmega series or any other AVR microcontroller.
- **Compiler**: AVR-GCC (GNU Compiler Collection for AVR).
- **Programming Tool**: AVR programmer to flash the HEX file onto the microcontroller.
- - **QEMU**: Emulator for simulating AVR microcontrollers.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RahulECE/AVR_UART_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd AVR_UART_Project
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Use the provided `Makefile` to build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

1. **Flash the Microcontroller**:
   Use your AVR programmer to flash the `main.hex` file onto the microcontroller.

2. **Connect a UART Terminal**:
   Connect a UART terminal to the microcontroller and set the baud rate to 9600.

3. **Observe the Output**:
   The terminal should display "Hello" every second.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Output**: Check the UART connection and ensure the baud rate is correctly set.
- **Compilation Errors**: Verify that you have AVR-GCC installed and correctly configured.
